RiiConnect24 DNS Server [![Actions Status](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/DNS-Server/workflows/Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/DNS-Server/actions)
===

This DNS Server will run locally on your computer and allow your Wii to connect to RiiConnect24 servers even if your ISP blocks connections to our DNS Server. When you use the DNS on your Wii or with this app, it also enhances the use of services such as Wiimmfi. This tool can also be used as a DNS server for Nintendo DS games.

## Setup

Setup process is the same as shown on our guide
https://wii.guide/riiconnect24 

You will only need to change DNS Settings in your Wii.

First, make sure that your Wii is connected to the same network as your computer is.

**If you use Pi-hole, please see [Setting up Pi-hole](#Setting-up-Pi-hole)**

# Running on Windows:

Run the .exe provided [on the releases page](https://github.com/RiiConnect24/RiiConnect24-DNS-Server/releases). If your antivirus notifies you about the .exe file, allow it and run it. If it doesn't work, you should also allow communication for this this .exe in your firewall settings.

# Running on Linux/macOS:

You will need to install Python 3 and run these commands in the Terminal.

> pip install dnslib requests

To run it, simply type in:

> sudo python3 RiiConnect24-DNS-Server.py

Replace `python3` with the name/path to your Python binary if necessary

# How to use it?

After starting the program, it will download the current list of the DNS Addresses to forward and will run. 

On screen, you will see the IP Address assigned to your computer by the DHCP Server on your NAT (router).

If your Wii is connected to the same network as your PC, it will be able to connect to the server on your PC.

# Compiling on Windows

To compile this app on Windows, you will need to run these two commands (Important: Pyinstaller currently fails to build with Python 3.8, use Python 3.7.5):
>pip install dnslib requests pyinstaller

Once it's done installing, run:
>pyinstaller RiiConnect24-DNS-Server.spec

| Tip: You may need to edit RiiConnect24-DNS-Server_v1.0.spec so the compiling process works on your computer.

# Setting up Pi-hole

On the server running Pi-hole, run either of these commands:

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RiiConnect24/DNS-Server/master/dns_zones-hosts.txt >> /etc/pihole/custom.list
```

```bash
sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robcmo/DNS-Server/master/dns_zones-hosts.txt -o /etc/pihole/custom.list -a
```

RiiConnect24 domains will be listed on Pi-hole webpage menu under "Local DNS Records".
